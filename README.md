### Step1: Install Gradle

**For MAC:**

brew install gradle

**For WINDOWS:**

 [https://services.gradle.org/distributions/](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/)

Download:

gradle-8.6-bin.zip

### Step 2: Extract only wrapper files

From the extracted folder, copy:

bin/gradle

bin/gradle.bat

bin/gradle-wrapper-*.jar

**GitHub Actions are reusable, versioned automation units that standardize CI/CD tasks, allowing teams to focus on build logic rather than environment setup.**
